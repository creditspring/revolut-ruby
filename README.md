## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'revolut'
```

## Usage

### Authentication

When you sign up for an account, you can generate production or sandbox **API key** in settings page.
You will need this API key to communicate with [Revolut][revolut] API.
When testing, you should use Sandbox environment.

Before making any request, you should authenticate first. Use the response object to
make requests afterward.


```ruby
client = Revolut::Client.new(api_key: 'my-secret-api-key')
```

Example:

```ruby
client.accounts
```

Or create file under `config/initializers/revolut.rb`

```ruby
Revolut.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = 'my-secret-api-key'
  config.environment = :sandbox  # :production
end
```

When you configured global settings in file, then you can request methods
on `Revolut` class directly.

Example:

```ruby
Revolut.accounts
```
